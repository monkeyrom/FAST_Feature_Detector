# FAST Feature Detector

The provided Python project uses the OpenCV library to perform real-time keypoint detection using the FAST (Features from Accelerated Segment Test) algorithm. It captures video from a camera, applies FAST algorithm for keypoint detection, and displays the original video along with the detected keypoints.

The code begins by importing the necessary libraries: cv2, matplotlib.pyplot, and numpy. It then creates a VideoCapture object to access the camera stream.

An instance of the FAST feature detector is created using FastFeatureDetector_create(). The default parameters are used.

The code enters a while loop that continuously reads frames from the video stream. It converts the frames to RGB color space and grayscale for keypoint detection. The original RGB frame is displayed.

The FAST algorithm is applied to the grayscale frame, detecting keypoints with non-maximum suppression. These keypoints are drawn on a copy of the RGB frame. The image with keypoints is displayed, and the number of keypoints detected is printed.

The loop continues until the user presses 'q', at which point the program exits gracefully.

This project demonstrates real-time keypoint detection using the FAST algorithm with OpenCV. It allows for exploration and modification of algorithm parameters and serves as a foundation for computer vision tasks.

In summary, the project captures video, applies the FAST algorithm for keypoint detection, and displays the original video with detected keypoints. It provides an opportunity to experiment with OpenCV and delve into computer vision applications.
